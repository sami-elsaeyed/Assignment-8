I couldnt get the cells to show the border using css. The boxes sizes and  background color changes when I edit the css file but the borders just wouldnt show up. I entered the word hello just to show that the cells are infact being created and the buttons/onclick color change are working. When doing this exercise using the dom the border worked.
